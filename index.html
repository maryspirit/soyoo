			<h2>Sound</h2>
		
		
			<p>Everybody hears sound from everywhere.Sound is a form of energy which produces a sensation of hearing in our ears.There are also other forms of energy like mechanical energy,heat energy,light energy etc.When you clap a sound is produced.</p><br>

			<p>We can also produce sound  by plucking,scratching,rubbing,blowing or shaking different objects.There are objects that vibrate and produce sound.Vibration means a kind of rapid to and fro motion of an object.The sound of the human voice  is produced due to vibrations in the vocal cords</p><br>

			<h3>PROPAGATION OF SOUND</h3>
			<p>Sound is produced by vibrating objects.The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium.It can be solid,liquid or gas.Sound moves through a  medium from the point of generation to the listener.When an object vibrates it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating.The particles do not travel all the way from the vibrating object to the ear.A particle of the medium in contact with with the vibrating  object is first displaced from its equilibrium position.It then exerts a force on the adjacent  particle.As a result of which the adjacent  particle gets displaced from its position of rest.After displacing  the adjacent particle  the first particle comes back to its original position.This process continues in the medium till the sound reaches your ear.The disturbance  created by a source of sound in the medium travels through the medium and not the particles of thee medium.</p><br>

			<p>A wave is a disturbance that moves through  a meduim when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion.They in turn produce similiar  motion in others.The particles of the medium do not move forward themselves but the disturbance is carried forward.This is what happens during propogation of sound in a medium,hence sound can be visualised as a wave.Sound waves are characterized by the motion of particles in the medium and are called mechanical waves.</p><br> 


			<p>Air is the most common medium through which sound travels.When a vibrating object moves  is moving forward,it pushes and compresses  the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure.This region is called a compression.This compression starts to move away from the vibrating object.When the vibrating  object moves backwards,it creates a region of low pressure  called rarefaction.As the object moves  back and forth rapidly,a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air.These  make the sound wave that propagates through the medium.Compression is the region of high pressure and rarefactions is the region of low pressure.
			</p><br>

			<p> Pressure is related to the number of particles  of a medium in a given volume.More density of the particles in the medium gives more pressure and vice versa.Thus,propagation of sound can be visualised as propagation of densityvariations or pressure variations in the medium.</p><br>


			<h3>SOUND WAVES ARE LONGITUDINAL WAVES</h3>

			<p>The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions and the regions where the coils are further apart are called  rarefactions..Sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions.Now,we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium.These waves are called longitudinal waves.In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction  of propagation of the dusturbance.The particles do not move  from one place to another  but they simply oscillate  back and forth about their position of rest.This is how wave propagates hence sound waves are longitudinal waves.</p><br>

			<p>There is also another type of wave,called a transverse wave.In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the line of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about thier mean position as the wave travels.Thus a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.</p><br>

			<h3>SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT MEDIA</h3>

			<p>Sound propagates through a medium at a finite apeed.The sound of a thunder is heard a little later than the flash of light is seen.So,we can make out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light.The speed of sound depends on the properties  of the medium through which  it travels.The speed of sound in a medium depends  on temperature of the medium.The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state.In any medium as we increase the temperature  the speed of sound increases.</p><br>

			<h3>REFLECTION OF SOUND</h3>
			<p>Sound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a rubber ball bounces off a ball.Like light,sound gets reflected  at the surface of a solid or liquid and follows the  same laws of reflection.The direction s in which the sound is incident  and is reflected  make equal angles with the normal ton the reflecting surface at the point of incidence,and the three ae in the same place.An obstacle of large size which may be polished or rough is needed for the reflection of sound waves.</p><br>

			<h3>ECHO</h3>
			<p>If we shout or clap near a suitable reflecting object such as a tall building or a mountain,we will hear the same sound again a little later.This sound which we hear is called  an echo.The sensation of sound persists  in our brain for about 0.1 s.To hear a distinct echo the time interval between the original sound  and the reflected one must be atleast 0.1s.If we take the speed of sound to be 344m/s at a given temperature,say at 22C in air,the sound  must go to the obstacle and reach back the ear  of the listener on reflection after  0.1s.Hence,the total distance covered bybthe sound  from the point of generation to the reflecting surface  and back should be atleast (344 m/s) x 0.1 s=34.4m.Thus,for hearing  distinct echoes,the minimium distance of the obstacle from the source of sound must be  half of the distance,that is,17.2 ,.This distance  will change with the temperature of air.Echoes may be heard mre than once due to successive or multiple reflecions.The roaring of thunder is due to the successive  reflections of the sound from a number of reflecting surfaces,such ad the clouds or the land.</p><br>

			<h3>REVERBERATION</h3>
			<p>A sound created ina big hall will persist by repeated eflection from the walls until it is reduced to a value where it is no longer audible.The repeated reflection that results in this persistence of sound is called reverberation.In an auditorium or big hall excessive reverberation is highly undesirable.To  reduce reverberation,the roof and walls of the auditorium are generally covered  with sound-absorbent materials like compressed fibreboard,rough plaster or draperies.The seat materials are also selected  on the basis of their sound absorbing properties.</p><br>


			<h3>RANGE OF HEARING</h3>
			<p>The audible range of sound for human beings extends from about 20 Hz to 20000Hz.Children under the age of five and some animals,such as dogs can hear up to 25 kHz.As people grow older their ears become less sensitive  to higher frequencies.Sounds of frequencies  below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or infrasound.If we could hear infrasound we would hear the vibrations of a pendulam just as we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee.Rhinoceroses communicate using infrasound of frequency as low as 5 HzWhales and elephants produce  sound  in the infrasound range.It is observed  that some animals  get disturbed before earthquakes.Earthquakes produce  low-frequency  infrasound before the main  shock waves  begin which posssibly alert the animals.Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound.Ultrasound is produced by dolphins,bats and porpoises.Moths of certain families have very sensitive hearing equipment.These moths can hear the high frequency squeaks of the bat and know when a bat is flying nearby,and are  able to escape capture.Rats also play games by producing ultrasound.</p><br>

			<h3>SONAR</h3>
			<p>The acronym SONAR stands for Sound Navigation And Ranging.Sonar is a device that uses ultrasonic waves to measure the distance,direction and speed of underwater objects.How does the sonar work?Sonar consists of a transmitter and a detector and is installed in a boat or a ship.</p><br>

			<p>The transmitter produces and transmits ultrasonic waves.These waves travel through water and after striking the object on the  seabed,get reflected back and are sensed by the detector.The detector  converts the ultrasonic waves into electrical signals which are appropriately interpreted.The distance of the object that reflected the sound wave can be calculated  by knowing the speed  sound in water and the time interval between transmission and reception of the ultrasound.Let the time interval between transmission and reception of ultrasound signal be t and the speed of sound through seawater  be v.The total distance ,2v travelled by the ultrasound is then ,2d = v x t. </p><br>

			<p>The above method is called echo-ranging.The sonar technique  is used to determine the depthof the sea and to locate underwater hills,valleys,submarine,icebergs,sunken ship etc.</p><br>
